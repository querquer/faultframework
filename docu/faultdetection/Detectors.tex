\begin{abstract}
 This document is meant to list up different methods for sensor fault detection. Furthermore, all methods should be classified whether they can handle specific fault types or not. As we assume the sensor signal as the only input of the fault detection methods, another classification is done concerning the dynamic of the input signal. This classification is done by deciding whether a method is able to detect a specific fault type in a high/middle/low dynamic signal.

\section{Preparation}
 
\subsection{Fault model}  
  We want to classify sensor fault detection methods concerning specific fault types, the first step is to introduce the underlaying fault model. The model used for this analysis was investigated by Sebastian Zug et. al. %\cite{Zug}.
