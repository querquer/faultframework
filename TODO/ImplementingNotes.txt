Overview Model-Parameters:

	sample_time	specifies the length of every timestep
	SimLength	Specifies length of whole simulation 

Notes on Implementing:

	- Do not limit the simulation-time of any submodel, always use 'inf'. As we will stop the Main-model after a certain time, 
	all submodels will stop to. Therefore there is no need to specify the simulation-time inside of any submodel.

	- Please always comment Matlab-Code in order to produce a more understandable system.
